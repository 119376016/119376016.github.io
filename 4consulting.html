			<h2>Hyper-automation</h2>
		</div>
		
		<p><a href="https://www.uipath.com/rpa/hyperautomation" target="blank">Hyper-automation</a> deals with the application of advanced technologies, including artificial
		intelligence (AI) and machine learning {ML), to increasingly automate processes and augment humans. Hyper-automation extends across a range of tools that can be automated,
		but also refers to the sophistication of the automation. In simple terms, it refers to the mixture of automation technologies that exist to augment and expand human capabilities.
		<br></br>
		It means that low-value tasks are optimally performed with automation tools, machine learning and advanced artificial intelligence so that outputs can be produced 
		automatically and run efficiently with little to no human intervention.</p>

			<h2>MultiExperience</h2>
		</div>
		
		<p>A <a href="https://techhq.com/2019/11/why-businesses-are-developing-multiexperience/" target="blank">multi-experience</a> development platform (MXDP) is a development platform that is used for developing not just mobile and web applications, but also chat, voice, augmented
		reality and wearable experiences. MXDP platforms help businesses quickly scale their app development projects across a range of devices, platforms, and form factors. 
		Basically, MXDPs are the evolution of omnichannel MADPs.</p>

			<h2>Distributed Cloud</h2>
		</div>
		
		<p>A <a href="https://www.sdxcentral.com/cloud/definitions/what-is-distributed-cloud-definition/" target="blank">distributed file system for cloud</a> is a file system that allows many clients to have access to data and supports operations (create, delete, modify, read, write) on that
		data. Each data file may be partitioned into several parts called chunks. Each chunk may be stored on different remote machines, facilitating the parallel execution of
		applications. Typically, data is stored in files in a hierarchical tree, where the nodes represent directories. There are several ways to share files in a distributed
		architecture: each solution must be suitable for a certain type of application, depending on how complex the application is. Meanwhile, the security of the system must be
		ensured. Confidentiality, availability and integrity are the main keys for a secure system. 
		<br></br>
		Users can share computing resources through the Internet thanks to cloud 
		computing which is typically characterized by scalable and elastic resources â€“ such as physical servers, applications and any services that are virtualized and allocated 
		dynamically. Synchronization is required to make sure that all devices are up-to-date.
		<br></br>
		Distributed file systems enable many big, medium, and small enterprises to store and access their remote data as they do local data, facilitating the use of variable
		resources.</p>
