			<h2>About Us</h2>
		</div>
		
		<p>Hurley Consulting is the business of Diarmuid Hurley and is one of Ireland’s leading and most experienced technological consultancy firms. 
		The firm was established by Diarmuid Hurley in 2007 to provide a wide-ranging consultancy service in technology and IT. 
		In this time it has grown to be one of the largest Irish-owned consultancies, with a diverse client base across an increasingly broad range of sectors of the industry.

		<br></br>
		
		Formed in Cork originally, the company opened an office in Dublin soon after, followed by another office in Galway. Further geographic expansion took place in 2014, 
		when we opened an office in Manchester having acquired a local well-established practice there. In 2015, we opened a new office in Limerick to further improve our regional 
		coverage within Ireland.

		<br></br>
		
		This steady growth has given us the scale and resources to deliver large and complex projects, both nationally and overseas. Our clients include Government Departments, 
		local authorities, private developers and major international companies. We have successfully delivered individual projects of up to €450m, and these projects have been 
		delivered in Ireland, the United Kingdom, mainland Europe, the Middle East and North Africa.

		<br></br>

		Our company ethos remains true to the original ethos of our founder, Diarmuid Hurley – that is, to provide our clients with an economic solution in an efficient manner, 
		while maintaining the highest levels of quality in both our service and in our finished product. We constantly strive to meet and exceed our client requirements and to 
		answer the market needs whilst maintaining our reputation for effective team work, client attention and the highest levels of service. This is reflected in the level of 
		repeat business and the long term relationships we maintain with our client base.
